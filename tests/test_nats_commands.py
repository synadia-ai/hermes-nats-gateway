"""Phase 7: NATS slash-command routing — data-only verification.

This phase introduces no new adapter code; Phase 4 already wires
``_on_prompt`` through ``_dispatch_command`` / ``_message_handler`` for
any prompt classified by ``_looks_like_command``. These tests pin the
invariants a fresh reviewer would need to check by hand:

* Every command name/alias advertised to gateway callers (the
  ``GATEWAY_KNOWN_COMMANDS`` set derived from ``COMMAND_REGISTRY``) is
  classified as a command by ``_looks_like_command`` — so the adapter
  won't silently route a slash command down the text-prompt path.

* Every such command resolves back to a ``CommandDef`` via
  ``resolve_command`` — proving the adapter-produced ``MessageEvent``
  will hit a known handler in ``gateway/run.py::_handle_message`` rather
  than being treated as unknown text.

* The eight commands explicitly called out in design doc §10 (and
  progress doc T7.1) are all gateway-available.

* ``/help`` renders as a single plain-text ``ResponseChunk`` over NATS —
  no attachments, no structured extras — and the payload is the real
  ``gateway_help_lines()`` output, so a future change to the help
  renderer can't silently degrade the NATS experience.
